# TrueCraft SMP Evolves Into TrueCraft Network

![TrueCraft Banner](https://news.truecraft.top/static/images/get_stard.jpg)

The **TrueCraft SMP** is growing and transforming into something bigger:  
Welcome to the **TrueCraft Network**! ðŸŽ‰  

With this evolution, we're bringing **Lifesteal** and **Survival Season 2** under one roof, creating more ways to enjoy your Minecraft adventures.  

## Why the Change?

Our community askedâ€”and we listened!  
- Some players wanted **PvP action**.  
- Others preferred a **peaceful survival world**.  

So instead of choosing, we decided to **give both**!  
Now, the TrueCraft Network provides a balance of gameplay experiences for **everyone**.

## Whatâ€™s Coming?

- **Lifesteal**: A high-stakes PvP mode where survival means everything.  
- **Survival Season 2**: A fresh new start for players who enjoy building, exploring, and thriving peacefully.  

This dual approach ensures the **TrueCraft Community** can find the playstyle that suits them best.

## Development Phase â€“ Play Public Now!

Right now, the **SMP is still public** as we continue developing **Lifesteal, Survival S2, and other features**.  
That means you can **join early, play now, and be part of the journey!**

## How to Join?

1. Head to the **TrueCraft Discord**.  
2. Stay updated on development progress.  
3. Jump into the SMP while itâ€™s open to the public!
