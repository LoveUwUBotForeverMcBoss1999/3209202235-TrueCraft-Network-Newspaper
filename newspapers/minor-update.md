# Server Maintenance Completed ✅

## What Happened?

Yesterday (**Dec 1, 2025**) and earlier today around noon, the server had heavy lag and high ping.  
Our checks showed the cause: a large redstone setup generating constant activity.

During today's maintenance, we added a new **Redstone Limiter** to prevent this from happening again.

## About the Redstone Limits

- Small farms still work fine  
- Larger machines now have limits  
- Exact values will not be published  

This system reduces lag, stops exploit machines, and improves overall performance.

## What's New?

✨ **Redstone Limiter added**  
✨ **New Quest System:**  
- **17 categories**  
- **1400 total quests**

Huge content drop for players who enjoy progression and challenges.
